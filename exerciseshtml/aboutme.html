     <b>About Me:</b><br>
     Hi, my name is Alex.<br>
I am an italo-american student at Northeastern University, where I am majoring in Game Design. I lived all of my life up until high school in Rome Italy, where I was studying in a French school.
I got accepted at Northeastern University and decided to start my career as a student in NUIN Ireland, where I studied at the DBS(Doublin Business School).<br>
I then proceeded to come back to Boston, where I started working on my understanding of games and the theories behind them. I started my first internship at Northeastern University where I worked for six months with professor Casper Hatevel on his Mixed reality project, an educational game for engineering students.
I proceeded to work with Kellian Adams at Green Door Labs for eight months as my second Internship. I was involved creating art for games and comic books as well as some game developmend.
